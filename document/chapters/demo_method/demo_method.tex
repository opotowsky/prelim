\chapter{Methodology and Demonstration}
\label{ch:demo_method}

This chapter first covers the methodology of the proposed work by introducing
each experimental component and a demonstration of each component. This has been 
split into three sections, summarized below.

Section \ref{sec:training} discusses how the training data is obtained.  After
the initial training data is simulated in Section \ref{sec:snfsim}, with a
possible information reduction step in Section \ref{sec:inforeduc}, it will be
input to a statistical learner. 

Section \ref{sec:statmodel} is about algorithms that use the features and
labels of the training data to statistically formulate a model. Algorithm
choice and parameters are discussed in Section \ref{sec:choice}.  Next, the
main goal for these machine-learned models is to supply reactor parameters
associated with some unknown \gls{SNF}. Section \ref{sec:rxtrparam} shows the
results of testing this goal: the prediction of a new instance that has only
features and no label.  

Finally, the algorithms are evaluated for accuracy and validated, as shown
in Section \ref{sec:valid}. In practice, validation is more than just making sure the
models are properly fit to the data.  Perhaps the training set was not
representative of the actual data space, whereas other methods do not rely on
the data space for results. To both understand the performance and validate
the models, the results are then evaluated for over- or under-fitting.

This work incorporates some methods and suggestions from previous work on the
subject \cite{dayman_feasibility_2013} regarding machine learning model
performance with respect to information reduction.  This is to establish some
baseline expectations of reactor parameter prediction and how the different
algorithms perform. 

Next, this work will expand upon the previous work in two ways.  The first is
adding a different information reduction technique via applying a gamma
spectroscopy \gls{DRF} to the \gls{SNF} nuclide recipes, which can calculate
various spectra based on the types of gamma detectors available to the
forensics community.  Secondly, a more advanced machine learning algorithm,
support vector regression, is included so as to compare more complex models
against simpler models.  A schematic of the workflow involving the experimental
components is shown in Figure \ref{fig:method}.

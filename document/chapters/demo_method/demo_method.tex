\chapter{Methodology and Demonstration}
\label{ch:demo_method}

This chapter first covers the methodology of the proposed work by introducing
each experimental component and following up with a demonstration of each
component. This has been split into three sections, summarized below.

Section \ref{sec:training} discusses how the training data set is obtained.
This is a set of observations with known inputs, i.e., labels that are to be
predicted. After the initial training data is simulated in Section
\ref{sec:snfsim}, with a possible information reduction step in Section
\ref{sec:inforeduc}, the data set will be input to a statistical learner for
the next step: training a model.

Section \ref{sec:statmodel} is about which algorithms use the training set.
They use the features and labels in the training data to formulate a model.
Algorithm choice and parameters are discussed in Section \ref{sec:choice}.
Next, the main goal for these \gls{ML} models is to supply reactor
parameters associated with some unknown \gls{SNF}. Section \ref{sec:rxtrparam}
shows the results of testing this goal: the prediction of a new instance that
has only features and no burnup label.  

Finally, the algorithms are evaluated for accuracy and validated, as shown in
Section \ref{sec:valid}. In practice, validation implies more than just
ensuring the models are properly fit to the data.  Perhaps the training set was
not representative of the actual data space, whereas non-statistical methods do
not rely on the data space for results. To both understand the performance of
the models, the results are then evaluated for over- or under-fitting.

The demonstrations of the above are based on previous work on the subject
\cite{dayman_feasibility_2013} regarding \gls{ML} model performance
with respect to information reduction.  Replicating the methodology helps to
establish some baseline expectations of reactor parameter prediction and how
the different algorithms perform. 

Next, this work will expand upon the previous work.  The first is adding a
different information reduction technique via gamma energies from the \gls{SNF}
nuclide recipes.  Following this, one could apply a \gls{DRF} that calculates
various spectra based on the types of gamma detectors available to the
forensics community (The information reduction step is not demonstrated here).
Secondly, a more advanced \gls{ML} algorithm, support vector regression, is
included to compare a complex model against the two simpler models.  A
schematic of the workflow involving the experimental components is shown in
Figure \ref{fig:method}.

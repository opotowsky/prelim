\subsubsection{Algorithm Choice}
\label{sec:choice}

Choice: Algorithm choice is usually based on what is being predicted and intuition
regarding strengths and weaknesses of different optimizations.  For a
benchmarking excercise, some machine learning approaches here were chosen based
on previous work \cite{dayman_feasibility_2013}: nearest neighbor and ridge
regression. This work will also extend to a more complex model via an algorithm
that is known to handle highly dimensional data sets well: support vector
regression.  These algorithms are introduced in \label{sec:algs}.

Many algorithms are developed on an assumption that the training set will be
\gls{i.i.d.}. This is important so that the model does not overvalue or overfit
a certain area in the training space. The testing error can therefore be

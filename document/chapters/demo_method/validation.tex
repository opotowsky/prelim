Evaluation and Diagnostics: To obtain reliable models, one must both choose or create a training set
carefully and study the impact of various algorithm parameters on the error.
Many algorithms are developed on an assumption that the training set will be
independent and identially distributed (i.i.d.). This is important so that the
model does not overvalue or overfit a certain area in the training space. The
testing error can therefore be tabulated with respect to training set size,
number of features, or algorithm parameters (regularization terms, etc). The
results are broadly known as diagnostic plots. 

Alg Compare: inverse prob theory

As previously mentioned in the \todo{add label} demonstration section, the
validation was carried out as a comparison of accuracies of the predicted
classes (reactor type, \todo{other classification tasks?}) and values
(enrichment amount \todo{or burnup?}) to the classes and values in the
predetermined test data set (discussed in \todo{add label when this section is
done}). 

However, because it is difficult to ensure consistently representative testing
data, the accuracy of a learned model should not depend on only one testing set
\todo{general knowledge or citation?}. The learned model's accuracy can be
better evaluated as discussed in \todo{the algorithm validation section} by
using cross validation \todo{should this be introduced in the background?}.
Other additional evaluation methods will be discussed here as well.  \todo{ROC
curves, confidence intervals on error, confusion matrix if necessary}

In addition to evaluating a single learned model, it may be beneficial to
compare models. As discussed in \todo{the algorithm comparison section}, there
are three methods that will be used: comparison of \gls{ROC} curves, scatter
plots, and pairwise \textit{t}-tests.

Additionally, machine learning algorithms are heavily dependent on the inputs
and parameters given to them, such as training set sizes, learning rates,
regularization, etc. To evaluate the performance or tweak the model from an
algorithm, diagnostic plots will be used. Learning and validation curves will
indicate how the models are performing, initially both with respect to the
testing error and the cross validation error. As previously mentioned, these
two errors are to be compared to the training error to understand the
prediction and generalization strength with respect to training set size and
the algorithm parameters governing model complexity. 

The learning curves were obtained as follows. For a given (randomly chosen)
training set size between 15 and 100\% of the total data set, several training
and prediction rounds were performed. The repetition for obtaining the testing
error is the same value as the \textit{k} in k-fold cross validation. The
testing error scenario averages the values of the obtained errors whereas the
k-fold cross-validation performs this automatically.  The validation curves
were obtained as follows. For a given parameter, the value of the parameter is
varied and \textit{k} training and prediction phases are completed, and their
errors averaged. Again, for k-fold cross-validation, these errors are already
averaged. The learning curves help determine if we are over- or under-training.
The validation curves help determine the optimal way to be robust to over- and
under-fitting.

Want to show the difference between test/train error plots and CV/train error
plots.  Determine some argument that perfers the latter. For the above
categories in the validation section, can show plots directly next to each
other (for 1, 2, 3) to hopefully show that cross validation provides better
generalizability.

Options for comparison of algorithms: inverse bayesian stuff, comparing
classification of 2 classes on same ROC plot with multiple ML systems, Scatter
plots, Pairwise t-tests.

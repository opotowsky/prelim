\section{Experimental Components}

%Training data and more ORIGEN stuff 
%\input{chapters/demonstration/trainingsim}

I am SCALE \cite{scale}, an experimental component!

I am \gls{ORIGEN-ARP} \cite{origen}, another experimental component!

I am \gls{GADRAS-DRF} \cite{gadras}, yet another experimental component!

%DRF and Iso ID

%Demonstrate success with iso only

\subsection{Information Reduction}

This study evaluates the impact of randomly introduced error of varying amounts
on the ability of the algorithms to correctly predict the burnup. Thus, first
investigated are the three algorithms with no error introduced, and next with
the random errors applied uniformly to each nuclide vector. Since error in a
nuclide vector is not random, in fact it is systematic and dependent on a
number of known sources of uncertainty, the next study will introduce error by
limiting the nuclides to only those that can be measured with a gamma
spectrometer (future work).

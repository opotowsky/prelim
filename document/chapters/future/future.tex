\chapter{Future and Alternative Work}
\label{ch:future}

\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:expand}

This is how I will expand upon the experiments given the time.  So many
options.

\section{Alternative Directions}
\label{sec:riskmitig}

This is the section on risk mitigation. Basically, say how \gls{UOC}, Pu, or
post-det could be covered with similar methodology.

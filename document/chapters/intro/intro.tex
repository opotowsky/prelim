\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:intro}

The realm of nuclear security involves many parallel efforts in
nonproliferation (verification of treaty compliance, monitoring for smuggling,
proper storage and transportation of nuclear materials), cyber security,
minimizing stocks of weaponizable materials, disaster response training, and
nuclear forensics. All of these efforts have been continually improving, but
there was a gap regarding the ability of the \gls{US} to coordinate and respond
to a nuclear incident, especially with the technical portion of nuclear
forensics: characterization and analysis. After all, the first textbook on the
topic was published in 2005 \todo{cite text}. In 2006, the \gls{US} \gls{DHS}
founded the \gls{NTNFC} within the \gls{DNDO}. The mission of the \gls{NTNFC}
is to establish a robust nuclear forensics capability to attribute radioactive
materials with demonstrable proof.

There are many fields that contribute to the nuclear forensics capability, such
as radiochemical separations, material collection techniques, improving
detector technology, material library development, and identifying forensic
signatures. These needs vary based on whether the material being collected is
post-detonation (i.e., bomb debris) or pre-detonation (i.e., spent nuclear
fuel). In the pre-detonation realm, this project focuses on statistical methods
to identify correlated material characteristics, which can lead to new forensic
signatures. 


\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

In the event of a nuclear incident, such as the retrieval of stolen nuclear
material or the detonation of a dirty bomb, it is necessary to learn as much as
possible about the source of the materials in a timely manner. In the case of
non-detonated special nuclear material, knowing the reactor parameters that
produced it can point investigators in the right direction in order to
determine the chain of custody of the interdicted material. Determining these
parameters (e.g., reactor type, cooling time, burnup) requires first
characterizing and calculating certain isotopic ratios, chemical compounds, or
trace elements.  Both radiological methods (e.g., gamma spectroscopy) and
ionization methods (e.g., mass spectrometry) measure these quantities. Although
both measurement techniques have a multitude of techniques within them and thus
varying strengths and weaknesses, the main tradeoff is between time/cost and
amount of information gained. 

The results of these analytic techniques are then compared against existing
databases to obtain the desired reactor parameters. These databases are highly
multidimensional, and furthermore, are rife with missing data entries and
inconsistent uncertainties. Direct comparison between measurement results and a
database therefore may not yield accurate results. Thus, computational
techniques have been developed by nuclear engineers to calculate the parameters
relevant to nuclear forensics analysis. \todo{Cite inverse stuff, possibly
adjoint?} Another approach with the uniqueness of requiring minimal domain
knowledge is the use of statistical methods via machine learning algorithms to
predict these characteristics or values. These algorithms can create a model
using the database entries that enables "filling between the lines" of its
entries. Additionally, having a machine-learned model may overcome the above
challenges of multidimensionality, missing data, and irregular uncertainty.

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

Talk about workflow here. Might need separate tex file. Prob should keep pretty
simple since everything is discussed later in the demonstration part of the
prelim.

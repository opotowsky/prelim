As previously mentioned, there are two main issues that are being addressed for
forensics of \gls{SNF}: database issues and speed of characterization.  Many
have begun considering computational techniques developed by nuclear engineers
to calculate the parameters relevant to nuclear forensics analysis.  One
example is the \gls{INDEPTH} tool \cite{weber_2006, weber_2010, weber_2011}.
\gls{INDEPTH} uses an iterative optimization method involving many forward
simulations to obtain reactor parameters of interest given some initial
guesses. 

Another approach utilizes \gls{AI} to solve nuclear forensics problems, such as
implementing searching algorithms for the database comparison step
\cite{gey_search} or \gls{ML} for determining reactor parameters from \gls{SNF}
characteristics \cite{dayman_feasibility_2013, nicolaou_2006, nicolaou_2009,
nicolaou_2014, robel_2009, pu_discrimination, jones_viz_2014, jones_snf_2014}.
A variety of statistical and \gls{ML} tools have been used to characterize
\gls{SNF} by predicting categories (e.g., reactor type, fuel type) as well as
predicting values (e.g., burnup, initial enrichment, cooling time). The former
uses classification algorithms and the latter uses regression algorithms, many
of which can be altered to perform both classification and regression.  

Statistical methods have the uniqueness of requiring minimal domain knowledge
via \gls{ML} algorithms that predict the characteristics or values of interest
\cite{dayman_feasibility_2013, pu_discrimination, robel_2009, nicolaou_2006,
nicolaou_2009, nicolaou_2014, jones_snf_2014, jones_viz_2014}.  They first
create a black-box statistical model using the entries of measurements in a
database. From that, they can predict the reactor parameters of an unknown
sample based on that model.  Having an \gls{ML} model based on a large number
of simulations may also overcome the challenges of missing data, irregular
uncertainty, or lack of information on other fuel cycles.  This logic also
follows for other computational methods using a large number of simulations.
Although they may not involve a resuable model, they also could overcome
missing data, irregular uncertainties, or ignorance of different or
non-commercial fuel cycles.  Also, it is generally known that statistical
methods will be able to either use or reduce the dimensions in the forensics
databases, which is another useful characteristic.

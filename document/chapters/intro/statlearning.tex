As previously mentioned, there are two main issues that are being addressed for
forensics of \gls{SNF}: database issues and speed of characterization.  Many
have begun considering computational techniques developed by nuclear engineers
to calculate the parameters relevant to nuclear forensics analysis.  One
example is the \gls{INDEPTH} tool \cite{weber_2006, weber_2010, weber_2011}.
\gls{INDEPTH} uses an iterative optimization method involving many forward
simulations to obtain reactor parameters of interest given some initial values. 

Another approach utilizes artificial intelligence to solve nuclear forensics
problems, such as implementing searching algorithms for the database comparison
step \cite{gey_search} and machine learning for determining reactor parameters
from \gls{SNF} characteristics \cite{dayman_feasibility_2013, nicolaou_2006,
nicolaou_2009, nicolaou_2014, nicolaou_2015, robel_2009, pu_discrimination,
jones_viz_2014, jones_snf_2014}.  A variety of statistical and machine learning
tools have been used to characterize spent fuel by predicting categories or
labels (e.g., reactor type, fuel type) as well as predicting values (e.g.,
burnup, initial enrichment, cooling time). The former uses classification
algorithms and the latter uses regression algorithms, many of which can be
altered to perform both classification and regression.  There is some promising
work discussed in Section \ref{sec:stats4nf} that shows certain applications of
machine learning can provide an additional tool for solving the forensics
problem, both qualitatively (for visualization) and quantitatively (for
prediction).

Statistical methods have the uniqueness of requiring minimal domain knowledge
via machine learning algorithms that predict the characteristics or values of
interest \cite{dayman_feasibility_2013, robel_2009, nicolaou_2006,
nicolaou_2009, nicolaou_2014, nicolaou_2015, jones_snf_2014, jones_viz_2014}.
They first create a black-box statistical model using the database entries, and
can predict the reactor parameters of an unknown sample based on that model.
Having a machine-learned model based on a large number of simulations may also
overcome the challenges of missing data, irregular uncertainty, or lack of
information on other fuel cycles.  This logic also follows for other
computational methods using a large number of simulations.  Although not
encompassed in a resuable model, they also could overcome missing data,
irregular uncertainties, or ignorance of different or non-commercial fuel
cycles.  Also, it is generally known that statistical methods will be able to
either use or reduce the dimensions in the forensics databases, which is
another useful characteristic.

\subsection{Fuel Cycle Simulation}

Nuclear fuel cycle studies involve the material flow of nuclear fuel. This can
be anywhere from mining to waste management, or focus on a process step
anywhere in between. Fuel cycle studies can be applied to any related subject,
such as economics, environmental impact, transportation planning, etc. In order
to draw conclusions from these studies, it is common to use a nuclear fuel
cycle simulator that tracks the quantities of interest. These allow the
comparison of different fuel types, reactor technologies, material processing
steps, etc. 

\subsection{Data Modification}

DRF Only?

\subsubsection{Detector Response Functions}

GADRAS

\subsubsection{Isotope Identification from Gamma Spectra}

Maybe don't need since its usefulness will be evaluated later on post-prelim?

I'm a section on the computational methods!

\subsection{Fuel Cycle Simulation}

Short blurb on FC sim (capabilities enable other materials to be studied beyond SNF)

\subsection{Data Modification}

Perfect data -> real world data

\subsubsection{Detector Response Functions}

GADRAS?

Discuss methods, and potential options. Am I implementing for prelim? 

\subsubsection{Isotope Identification from Gamma Spectra}

Same as above, but prob won't implement for prelim.

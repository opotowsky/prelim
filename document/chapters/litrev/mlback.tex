Machine learning is a sub-field of \gls{AI} within the broad category of
computer science. The goal of \gls{AI} is to create computer systems that
respond to their environment according to some set of criteria or goal. For
example, self-driving vehicles have computers on board that learn to avoid
curbs and humans. It is common knowledge that the use of \gls{AI} has been
expanding at a rapid rate in recent years. News stories of major tech
companies' \gls{AI} advancements are frequent and news articles abound with
data on which jobs will be replaced with \gls{AI} in the near future. 

While its use has been increasing in the commercial sector, there is also much
anecdotal evidence to support the existence of a rapid increase of \gls{AI} use
in academic research across many disciplines beyond robotics. \gls{AI} systems
have been used in detection (e.g., fraud or spam), medical diagnostics, user
analysis (e.g., Netflix ratings), and a host of scientific disciplines that
have increasing amounts of multivariate data.

Much of the recent advances to the field of \gls{AI} have occured in the
statistical realm, which forgoes domain knowledge in favor of large data sets.
Thus, machine learning and statistical learning has become somewhat of a
separate field. \todo{could explain more, cite changing science of ML} Machine
learning research focuses on the underlying algorithms using mathematical
optimization, methods for pattern recognition, and computational statistics.
As an application, however, this study is not concerned with computational
time, but rather the ability to correctly predict values and categories
relevant to the nuclear forensics mission. This restricts the relevancy of the
algorithms to the underlying theory and its impact on the resulting model's
accuracy. 

Machine learning algorithms can be separated into two main categories:
unsupervised and supervised learning.  The former groups or interprets a set of
input data, predicting patterns or structures. The latter includes both the
input and output data, enabling the trained model to predict future outputs.
Broadly speaking, the unsupervised learning algorithms are designed for
clustering data sets or dimensionality reduction (i.e., determining some subset
or linear combination of features most relevant to the input data) of data
sets.  Supervised learning algorithms predict both discrete and continuous
values via classification and regression, respectively. Some algorithms can
perform both classification and regression, and neural networks can even be
modified to perform either supervised or unsupervised learning. Additionally,
various algorithms can be strung together, which is referred to as
\textit{ensemble methods}. One common way of doing this is performing
deimensionality reduction prior to supervised learning.\todo{check that this
common workflow qualifies as ensemble} 

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:supervised}, a typical (supervised) machine
learning workflow begins with a training data set, which has a number of
\textit{instances}, or rows of observations of .  Each instance has some
\textit{attributes}, also referred to as \textit{features}, and a label, which
can be a categorical label or discrete/continuous values.  The training data
are then inserted into a statistical learner; this calculates some objective,
minimizes or maximizes that objective, and provides some model. This model is
typically evaluated using a test set that has the same set of attributes and
labels (but different instances). The comparison of what the model predicts and
the actual label gives the \textit{generalization error}. Depending on the
performance and application, the model may need improvement from more training
and/or some changes in the algorithm parameters. Once the model is performing
well enough and validated, it is finalized; then a user can provide a single
instance and a value can be predicted from that.

This study performs both classification and regression tasks using supervised
learning algorithms.  Differences among the underlying mathematics \todo{phrase
better} of the algorithms do impact the performance of a machine-learned model.
Therefore the algorithms used in this study will be discussed in Section
\ref{sec:algs}. Additionally, algorithm selection and assessment is covered in
Section \ref{sec:selectass}.  Evaluating and optimizing algorithm performance
is discussed in Section \ref{sec:optvalid}, as well as robustly comparing
different algorithms for validation.

\subsection{Classification and Regression Algorithms}
\label{sec:algs}

For relevant nuclear forensics predictions, both classification and regression
algorithms must be used.  For example, one may want to predict the reactor type
based on some measurements (referred to as features) of spent fuel of an
unknown source, and this would require a classification algorithm. Or perhaps
the input fuel composition is relevant to an investigation on weapons intent,
so a regression algorithm would be used to train a model based on some set of
features.  Since algorithm formulation impacts the resulting performance, they
are discussed in detail below.  

\todo{should add useful vocab: training data X and y, instances, features, etc}

\subsubsection{Linear Models}

One of the simplest and most obvious methods of prediction is a linear model
using a least-squares fit.

\todo{explain distance metrics} 


\begin{equation}
\hat{Y}(x) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{x_i \in N_k(x)} y_i
\end{equation}

Nearest neighbor regression calculates a value based on the instance that is
closest to it. The metrics for distance differ, but in this study, Euclidian
distance was used. There is no learning in this regression, per se; the
training set populates a space and the testing set is compared directly to
that. \cite{elements_stats} 


\subsubsection{Support Vector Machines}
\label{sec:svm}

Support vector regression (SVR) is an extension of the popular classification
algorithm, support vector machine (SVM).  This algorithm was chosen because of
its ability to handle highly dimensional data well, which in this study is
approximately 300 features. 

SVM classifies two classes by determining an optimal hyperplane, given by wx+b,
between them.  As seen in Figure ?, the algorithm evaluates the quality of the
line that separates two classes by maximizing the width of the margin given the
contraints surrounding the line.  Some problems are not linearly separable, and
thus a penalty term is introduced to allow for misclassifications. As shown in
Figure ?, the algorithm then simultaneously minimizes the misclassifications
while maximizing the margin. 

This can be extended easily to multidimensional analysis via what is called the
\textit{kernel trick}.  First, using a nonlinear kernel function maps the data
into higher dimensional feature space. Then the algorithm can find a linear
separation in this space, as shown in Figure ?. Further, this can be upgraded
from classification to SVR by doing similar math but instead minimizing the
margin, as shown in Figure ?. 

The kernel chosen for this study is the Gaussian radial basis function, shown
below. This has two tuneable parameters, gamma and C. Gamma influences the
width of influence of individual training instances, and strongly affects the
fitting of the model. Low values correspond to underfitting because the
instances have too large of a radius (low influence) and high values correspond
to overfitting because the instances have a small radius (high influence). 

The C parameter also affects the fitting of the model by allowing more or less
support vectors, corresponding to more or less misclassification. A lower C
smooths the surface of the model by allowing more misclassifications, whereas a
higher C classifies more training examples by allowing fewer
misclassifications. Too low and too high of a C can cause under- and
overfitting, respoectively. 

Since there is a tradeoff of fitting strength provided by both parameters, it
is common to run the algorithm on a logarithmic grid from 10'-3 to 10'3 for
each parameter. If plotted on a heatmap of accuracies given gamma and C, there
will be a diagonal of ideal combinations that emerges. The lowest of these is
usually chosen.

\subsection{Model Selection and Assessment}
\label{sec:selectass}

Brain dump:
Step 1 is model selection then assessment. Selection is estimating model
performance (via CV set) among a set of trained models. After one model is
chosen, assessment takes place by determining the prediction capability on new
data (via a testing set).  Why have two?  Validation set can be re-used on all
models, test set can only be used once (it should be invisible prior to the
testing phase).  In k-fold cross val, this is done all at once (selection is
pretty much based on the average performance of each fold's model). 

MATHS: Somewhere, discuss J functions (target function, objective function) and
how that is essentially error the alg is trying to minimize. Also need to
discuss the concept of regularization.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./chapters/litrev/BVtradeoff.png}
  \caption{Optimize that.}
  \label{fig:bvtradeoff}
\end{figure}

Evaluating the \textit{generalization} (i.e., prediction capability) of a
machine-learned model is important because the creation of statistically
learned models is a hidden process. This is done by taking a small portion of
the data set, and setting it aside as a testing set.  The rest of the data set
is known as the training set and is used to train a model. After training, the
test set is used to test the model.  

The generalization error is typically referred to as the \textit{testing
error}, as it is measuring the ability of the model to predict future cases
that were not introduced in the training phase (i.e., the test set entries).
Next, the \textit{training error} is provided by comparing the model
predictions to the training set, as the model would likely be smoother than the
potential noise the training set would include. This is useful to determine the
fitness of the model, the application of which is discussed below in Section
\ref{sec:optvalid}.

Although one could just train and test their model, there is a way to test the
model while still in the training phase. A testing set that would be used
during training to give feedback, a \textit{cross-validation} set, can provide
a faster convergence to a satisfactory model. As shown in Figure
\ref{fig:cverror}, this can be done by splitting the data set into three
groups: a large training set, a small cross-validation set, and a small testing
set. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./chapters/litrev/cverror.png}
  \caption{Illustration of how a dataset can be split up for model evaluation.}
  \label{fig:cverror}
\end{figure}

However, in practice, multiple rounds of cross-validation steps are used,
referred to as \textit{k-fold cross-validation}. This allows a user to use all
data entries as a testing entry once.  As illustrated in \ref{fig:cverror},
this splits the dataset into \textit{k} subsets. One set is designated as the
testing set (more correctly, the \textit{validation set}), and a model is
trained with the rest. Following the first training phase, another begins, this
time with a different subset as the validation set.  This process is performed
\textit{k} times to give \textit{k} models, and the models are then averaged,
providing an additional level of model validation than can be achieved with a
single testing set.

\subsection{Model Optimization and Validation}
\label{sec:optvalid}

It is unlikely to have a model perform as one expects the first time. There is
therefore a few techniques for optimizing the performance. It is important to
not optimize too much, however, because the performance could be linked to the
training set and might not generalize outside of the specific type of input
data used.  A workaround for this scenario is to obtain more data for the set
or to obtain a completely different data set altogether. 

Next is more diagnostics, the first of which is the learning curve. This tests
the model for high bias or high variance by plotting the prediction error with
respect to the training set size (i.e., number of instances/examples in the
training set). (explain mathematically, include schematic). Talk about three
scenarios for learning curves. Include reference from which the figures were
adapted.

    \label{fig:variance}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Learning curves for three training scenarios.}
  \label{fig:learning}
\end{figure}

After ensuring the appropriate training set size is selected, the models must
be further optimized using model diagnostics, known as learning curves and validation plots.

These also provide information on the bias-variance tradeoff with respect to
model complexity. Model complexity can be captured in the number of features
included in the training set and regularization parameters that can be varied
within the algorithm. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]

  \includegraphics[width=1.05\linewidth]{./chapters/litrev/ValidationCurve.png}
  \caption{Validation curve showing examples of different fittings.}
  \label{fig:validation}
\end{figure}

Various
factors can cause the model to be under- or overfit to the data, both of which
impact generalization: training set size, number of features in the data set,
aglorithm parameters


Plotting these two errors with respect to the model complexity gives what is known as 
a \textit{learning curve}. This is usually the first

bias-variance tradeoff

diagnostic and learning curves
When plotting the training and testing error
with respect to the number of instances, this is known as a learning curve.
When plotting these errors with respect to the number or features or algorithm
parameters, this is known as a validation curve. \todo{insert example

All methods:
Priors given by set of forward problems (input data space - ORIGEN sims)
Likelihood given by model space, e.g.: 
Model params as determined from ML alg
(related) MLE from bayesian inference
Direct inversion of matrix A
Expert-elicited params (i.e. initial guesses for INDEPTH? Or optimized ones?)
Marginal likelihood only needed for absolute measures - doesn’t affect relative probabilities

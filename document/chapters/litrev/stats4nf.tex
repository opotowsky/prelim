I'm the lit review section on previous applied ML work in the NF field.

It is first important to determine if statistical methods can overcome the
inherent database deficiencies. After that, the statistical methods must be
considered in such a way as to represent a real-world scenario. Although mass
spectrometry techniques provide extremely accurate isotopic information for
analytical methods, they are time-consuming and more expensive. And although
gamma spectroscopy can give extremely fast results cheaply, it only measures
certain radiological signals and is influenced by many environmental factors,
storage, and self-attenuation. As different machine learning algorithms and
parameters are investigated, this work focuses on probing the amount of
information required to obtain realistic results.


\subsection{Special Nuclear Materials Studied}

The review on nf for the whole fuel cycle is useful here, perhaps. This is also 
important when I discuss my risk management section later. 

\subsection{Statistical Methods Employed}

Very short details from lit review outline and success rates should be 
discussed here

Although the body of literature on the area of proposed research is not
expansive, there have been a number of relevant studies on the prediction of
reactor parameters using statistical methods. This section condenses these
studies by the materials and methods used.\todo{this ok org or should I do two
case studies?}

\subsection{Special Nuclear Materials Studied}

The review on nf for the whole fuel cycle is useful here, perhaps. This is also 
important when I discuss my risk management section later. 

UOC (LLNL)
Pu - Robel and Kristo (mention reprocessing)
SNF, a bunch



\subsection{Statistical Methods Employed}

Very short details from lit review outline and success rates should be 
discussed here

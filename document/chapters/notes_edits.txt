AI and ML do differ but they tend to be used synonymously now. Searching
algorithms aren't machine learning, for example. Should I expand on that or
find a reference? 

18-1 & 44-2

Machine-learned/trained models and statistical models are used interchangeably
in my prelim. It's not necessarily field lingo, just trying to maintain clarity
that these aren't physical models.  I don't think it makes a difference to say
'trained' versus 'learned', either.  Any other thoughts?

44-1

High bias (cause it's the error) is the cause, and an underfit model is the
effect. Can I explain this better?

50-1

The number of features are controllable, hand selecting fission products, for ex.

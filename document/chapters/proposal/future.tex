\subsection{Next Steps}

This is how I will expand upon the experiments given the time.  So many
options.

Diff algs ()
Diff sims (SFCOMPO space represented bc this offers better real-world testing for more technologies)


The next step is to provide a larger, more diverse training set to the
algorithms so they could predict better when faced with new instances.  Dayman
training/test set -> sfcompo-like sims and testing set

To obtain reliable models, one must both choose or create a training set
carefully and study the impact of various algorithm parameters on the error.
Many algorithms are developed on an assumption that the training set will be \gls{i.i.d.}.
This is important so that the
model does not overvalue or overfit a certain area in the training space.

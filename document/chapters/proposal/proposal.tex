Prop intro

\section{Summary of Experiments}
\label{sec:summary}

Table?

\section{Hypotheses}
\label{sec:hypotheses}

I hypothesize!

\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:expand}

This is how I will expand upon the experiments given the time.  So many
options.

Diff algs ()
Diff sims (SFCOMPO space represented bc this offers better real-world testing for more technologies)

\section{Alternative Directions}
\label{sec:riskmitig}

This is the section on risk mitigation. Basically, say how \gls{UOC}, Pu, or
post-det could be covered with similar methodology.

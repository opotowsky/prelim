The purpose of this work is to evaluate the utility of statistical methods as
an approach to determine forensics-relevant quantities for commercial spent
nuclear fuel as less information is available. Machine learning algorithms will
be used to train models to provide these values (e.g., reactor type, time since
irradiation, burnup) from the available information. The training data will be
simulated using ORIGEN, which will provide an array of nuclide concentrations
as the features ($X$) and the parameters of interest ($y$) are provided from the
simulation inputs. Information reduction will be carried out using
computationally generated gamma spectra; the radionuclide concentrations from
the simulations can be converted into gamma energies, which then undergo a
detector response calculation to represent real gamma spectra as closely as
possible. Machine learning best practices will be used to evaluate the
performance of the chosen algorithms, and inverse problem theory will be used
to provide an interval of confidence in the model predictions. \todo{copied from goals, fix up}

This proposal would not be possible with the wisdom and patience of my advisor,
Paul Wilson. I honestly don't have words for how grateful I am and lucky I
feel.  I'm also appreciative of the CNERG community for technical and
non-technical assistance; may quiche recipes be forever shared during important
phone calls.  Kelly Burton and Max Lagally have invested \textbf{much} effort
into my success and convinced me that graduate school was the right path for
me---more than once.  My GERS friends have given me so much in and out of
school, especially Jos\'e Roberto, Richard, and Chandler.  I have also received
generous funding from the National Science Foundation and the Department of
Homeland Security.

Mountains of personal support motivated me here and kept me here, which I do
not take for granted. Steven ``If you're gonna be dumb you gotta be tough''
Harrell, my chosen family, inspired me to get all my KSAs, no matter where I
wanted to find them. Robin, you have been such a light in my life for over a
decade and always remind me why I came back to grad school.  And to my friends
for 15 years, thanks for keeping in touch despite the gaps.  Denise and April,
it's been amazing to watch your wonderful transformations. Ruthie, you push me
to be fierce, spittin' truths and slaying your way through life.  And, always
last and usually the least (jk), my family; although far too long to list, some
have fought along with me this entire time.  Maurice, thanks for the help when
I was struggling. Lou, thanks for being one of my best friends and sourcies of
laugh lines. Liz, I love finding your inspirational notes around my home and my
kitchen floor clean. For endlessly encouraging my academic and personal
pursuits, I'm appreciative of my California family, Mel, Bonnie, Joelle, and
Jamie. 

Finally, my Madison family has blessed me in countless ways: Shan, Ninja,
Peter, Drax, Samira, Heather, Burnie, Brarit, Sarah, James, BLou, Fetal,
Martha, Matt, Troy.

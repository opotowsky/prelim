This proposal would not be possible with the wisdom and patience of my advisor,
Paul Wilson. May you never suffer another student like me.  I'm also
appreciative of the CNERG community for technical and non-technical assistance;
may quiche recipes be forever shared during important phone calls.  Kelly
Burton and Max Lagally have invested \textbf{much} effort into my success and
convinced me that graduate school was the right path for me---more than once.
My GERS friends have given me so much in and out of school, especially Jos\'e
Roberto, Richard, and Chandler.  I have also received generous funding from the
National Science Foundation and the Department of Homeland Security.

Mountains of personal support motivated me here and kept me here, which I do
not take for granted. Steven ``If you're gonna be dumb you gotta be tough''
Harrell, my chosen father, pushed me to get all my KSAs when I didn't want to
go to grad school.  Robin, you have been such a light in my life for over a
decade and always remind me why I came back to grad school.  And to my friends
for 15 years, Denise and April, thanks for keeping in touch despite the gaps.
Also, Ruthie, you push me to be fierce, spittin' truths and slaying your way
through life.  And my family; although far too long to list, some have fought
along with me this entire time.  Maurice, thanks for the help when I was
struggling.  Lou, thanks for being one of my best friends and sources of laugh
lines. Liz, you're grounded.  For tirelessly encouraging my academic and
personal pursuits, I'm appreciative of my California family, Mel, Bonnie,
Joelle, and Jamie. 

Finally, my Madison family has blessed me in countless ways: Shan, Krystal,
Ninja, Peter, Drax, Samira, Heather, Burnie, Brarit, Sarah, the late Otto,
James, Troy, BLou, Fetal, Martha, Matt.

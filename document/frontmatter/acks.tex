This proposal would not be possible with the wisdom and patience of my advisor,
Paul Wilson. I honestly don't have words for how grateful I am and lucky I
feel.  I'm also appreciative of the CNERG community for technical and
non-technical assistance; may quiche recipes be forever shared during important
phone calls.  Kelly Burton and Max Lagally have invested \textbf{much} effort
into my success and convinced me that graduate school was the right path for
me---more than once.  My GERS friends have given me so much in and out of
school, especially Jos\'e Roberto, Richard, and Chandler.  I have also received
generous funding from the National Science Foundation and the Department of
Homeland Security.

Mountains of personal support motivated me here and kept me here, which I do
not take for granted. Steven ``If you're gonna be dumb you gotta be tough''
Harrell, my chosen family, inspired me to get all my KSAs, no matter where I
wanted to find them. Robin, you have been such a light in my life for over a
decade and always remind me why I came back to grad school.  And to my friends
for 15 years, thanks for keeping in touch despite the gaps.  Denise and April,
I'm so glad we are still in touch. Ruthie, you push me to be fierce, spittin'
truths and slaying your way through life.  And, always last and usually the
least (jk), my family; although far too long to list, some have fought along
with me this entire time.  Maurice, thanks for the help when I was struggling.
Lou, thanks for being one of my best friends and sources of laugh lines. Liz, I
love finding my kitchen floor clean. For endlessly encouraging my academic and
personal pursuits, I'm appreciative of my California family, Mel, Bonnie,
Joelle, and Jamie. 

Finally, my Madison family has blessed me in countless ways: Shan, Ninja,
Peter, Drax, Samira, Heather, Burnie, Brarit, Sarah, the late Otto, James,
Troy, BLou, Fetal, Martha, Matt.

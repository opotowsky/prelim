	abstract = {The use of passive gamma and neutron signatures from fission indicators is a common means of estimating used fuel burnup, enrichment, and cooling time. However, while characteristic fission product signatures such as 134Cs, 137Cs, 154Eu, and others are generally reliable estimators for used fuel burnup within the context where the assembly initial enrichment and the discharge time are known, in the absence of initial enrichment and/or cooling time information (such as when applying NDA measurements in a safeguards/verification context), these fission product indicators no longer yield a unique solution for assembly enrichment, burnup, and cooling time after discharge. Through the use of a new Mesh-Adaptive Direct Search (MADS) algorithm, it is possible to directly probe the shape of this “degeneracy space” characteristic of individual nuclides (and combinations thereof), both as a function of constrained parameters (such as the assembly irradiation history) and unconstrained parameters (e.g., the cooling time before measurement and the measurement precision for particular indicator nuclides). In doing so, this affords the identification of potential means of narrowing the uncertainty space of potential assembly enrichment, burnup, and cooling time combinations, thereby bounding estimates of assembly plutonium content. In particular, combinations of gamma-emitting nuclides with distinct half-lives (e.g., 134Cs with 137Cs and 154Eu) in conjunction with gross neutron counting (via 244Cm) are able to reasonably constrain the degeneracy space of possible solutions to a space small enough to perform useful discrimination and verification of fuel assemblies based on their irradiation history.},

Various combinations of reactor type and fuel composition were analyzed using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLSDA) of the concentrations of nine U and Pu isotopes in fuel as a function of burnup. Real-world variation in the concentrations of 234U and 236U in the fresh (unirradiated) fuel was incorporated.

	abstract = {Nuclear forensics involves the analysis ofinterdicted nuclear material for specific material characteristics (referred to as “signatures”) that imply specific geographical locations, production processes, culprit intentions, etc.  Predictive signatures rely on expert knowledge of physics, chemistry, and engineering to develop inferences from these material characteristics.  Comparative signatures, on the other hand, rely on comparison of the material characteristics of the interdicted sample (the “questioned sample” in FBI parlance) with those of a set of known samples.  In the ideal case, the set of known samples would be a comprehensive nuclear forensics database, a database which does not currently exist.  In fact, our ability to analyze interdicted samples and produce an extensive list of precise materials characteristics far exceeds our ability to interpret the results.  Therefore, as we seek to develop the extensive databases necessary for nuclear forensics, we must also develop the methods necessary to produce the necessary inferences from comparison of our analytical results with these large, multidimensional sets of data.   In the work reported here, we used a large, multidimensional dataset of results from quality control analyses of uranium ore concentrate (UOC, sometimes called “yellowcake”).  We have found that traditional multidimensional techniques, such as principal components analysis (PCA), are especially useful for understanding such datasets and drawing relevant conclusions. In particular, we have developed an iterative partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) procedure that has proven especially adept at identifying the production location of unknown UOC samples.  By removing classes which fell far outside the initial decision boundary, and then rebuilding the PLS-DA model, we have consistently produced better and more definitive attributions than with a single pass classification approach. Performance of the iterative PLS-DA method compared favorably to that of classification and regression tree (CART) and k nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithms,with the best combination of accuracy and robustness, as tested by classifying samples measured independently in our laboratories against the vendor QC based reference set.},

	abstract = {The IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) figures from 2012 show that there have been in excess of 2,331 reported cases of trafficking of radioactive materials worldwide[1]. The hazardous nature of this material means that trafficking of such substances is cause for concern and should be combatted appropriately. Nuclear forensics is a field that has emerged as an anti- proliferation solution to this problem by extracting forensic information from radioactive materials to answer questions about the source of such unknown materials. Traditionally the elemental and isotopic composition of the material can be analyzed to determine attributes of the materials history using known characteristics such as isotopic ratios and trace elements. Through novel implementation of machine learning and pattern recognition techniques it is envisaged that spectral analysis will become faster and more accurate. Rather than using the ratios of specific isotopes and specific elemental compositions for analysis we have shown that machine learning allows the user to make use of the full extent of elemental and isotopic data available. These techniques have further been able to provide an effective set of tools for finding valuable insight into the provenance of a particular sample utilizing the posterior probability distribution of samples from a given reference dataset. Our work has focused on finding novel and effective machine learning techniques to aid the nuclear forensics process by providing visualisation of the complex datasets that result from spectral analysis of radioactive samples as well as generating classification models for determining attributes such as reactor design or the age of a given sample. A number of classification and visualisation techniques have been successfully tested on a set of datasets that are representative of a number of different radioactive substances from the nuclear fuel lifecycle. While each of these substances have their own challenges to address in terms of source determination, our work has successfully addressed the need to provide a well- informed analysis of the nuances of these datasets to effectively and accurately utilise the characteristics of the materials to make an informed decision regarding the origin of the substance. For instance, a representative dataset of post-irradiation samples have been used to demonstrate an effective classification model for determining the reactor design from which a sample may have originated. This analysis has been further supported by dimensional reduction techniques to generate visualisation of the dataset such that further conclusions can be drawn from the spread of the data. Results show that these techniques are very much capable of classifying spent reactor fuel with a level of accuracy that would certainly aid the decision making process with regards to determining the source of unknown substances in the fight against nuclear smuggling.},

    abstract = {In this paper we demonstrate the use of pattern recognition and machine learning techniques to determine the reactor type from which spent reactor fuel has originated. This has been done using the isotopic and elemental measurements of the sample and proves to be very useful in the field of nuclear forensics. Nuclear materials contain many variables (impurities and isotopes) that are very difficult to consider individually. A method that considers all material parameters simultaneously is advantageous. Currently the field of nuclear forensics focuses on the analysis of key material properties to determine details about the materials processing history, for example, utilizing known half-lives of isotopes can determine when the material was last processed (Stanley, F. E. J. Anal. At. Spectrom. 2012, 27, 1821; Varga, Z.; Wallenius, M.; Mayer, K.; Keegan, E.; Millet, S. Anal. Chem. 2009, 81, 8327−8334). However, it has been demonstrated that multivariate statistical analysis of isotopic concentrations can complement these method and are able to make use of a greater level of information through dimensionality reduction techniques (Robel, M.; Kristo, M. J. J. Environ. Radioact. 2008, 99, 1789−1797; Robel, M.; Kristo, M. J.; Heller, M. A. Nuclear Forensic Inferences Using Iterative Multidimensional Statistics.

Radioact. 2006, 86, 313−318; Pajo, L.; Mayer, K.; Koch, L. Fresenius’ J. Anal. Chem. 2001, 371, 348−352). There has been some success in using such multidimensional statistical methods to determine details about the history of spent reactor fuel (Robel, M.; Kristo, M. J.J. Environ. Radioact.2008,99,1789−1797). Here, we aim to expand on these findings by pursuing more robust dimensionality reduction techniques based on manifold embedding which are able to better capture the intrinsic data set information. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of a number of classification algorithms to reliably determine the reactor type in which a spent fuel material has been irradiated. A number of these classification techniques are novel applications in nuclear forensics and expand on the existing knowledge in this field by creating a reliable and robust classification model. The results from this analysis show that our techniques have been very successful and further ascertain the excellent potential of these techniques in the field of nuclear forensics at least with regard to spent reactor fuel.},

Previously, inverse methods were applied to the generic case of predicting the burnup, initial enrichment, and cooling time for selected spent nuclear fuels based on measured actinide and fission product concentrations.  These existing measurements were not developed or optimized for use by these inverse techniques, and hence previous work demonstrated the prediction of only the fuel burnup, initial enrichment, and cooling time.  Previously nine spent fuel samples from an online data compilation were randomly selected for study.  This work set out to demonstrate the full prediction capabilities using measured isotopic data, but with a more deliberate selection of fuel samples.  The current approach is to evaluate nuclides within the same element to see if complementary information can be obtained in addition to the reactor burnup, enrichment, and cooling.  Specifically, the reactor power and the fuel irradiation time values are desired to achieve the maximum prediction capabilities of these techniques.},

	abstract = {This work describes a nondestructive strategy and algorithm designed to evaluate the burnup and plutonium content of light-water-reactor spent fuel and thereby confirm declared values. In contrast with previous methods that focus on only a few photopeaks (e.g., 137 Cs at 662 keV), the present approach involves the entire gamma spectrum up to 2000 keV. Spectra are used as input for the inverse code INDEPTH, which is designed to predict reactor parameters (fuel enrichment, power level, irradiation time, and cooling time) when given either a set of nuclide inventories or the gamma spectrum that they produce. This approach has the advantage of often making possible the determination of parameters other than burnup when they are unknown or in doubt. In addition, error in one photopeak evaluation is mitigated by the inclusion of the entire spectrum. The solution procedure involves multiple runs of the forward code ORIGEN/ARP, each of which produces an extensive list of nuclides formed through depletion/decay processes. The gamma spectrum of these nuclides is compared with the gamma spectrum from a detector through a bin-by-bin sum of squared error. New choices for the reactor parameters that are input to ORIGEN/ARP are determined using a gradient search technique, and the best parameter set is that which minimizes the squared error between calculated and measured gamma spectra. The method is applied to the analysis of gamma data taken from various sections of actual spent reactor fuel and is compared with declared values and other methods of evaluation. The sensitivity of the inverse solution with respect to various parameters is calculated and indicates that the algorithm is stable and robust. One example includes the presence of multiple solutions, each of which can be characterized using additional information.},
